I think using Git to manage notes is a great idea so I'll start a blog at Github. Topics I might be interested in:

 - programming notes (Python/Go/React)
 - startup engineering: how to serve a new business(architecture, scalability, build, deploy, etc)
 - business in startup world
 - life at a startup
 - etc.
